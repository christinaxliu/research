This git repository contains the source code (including the Google Colab notebooks) for my research projects and work.

At this moment, it mainly contains my work during my summer research internship and year-long research program with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology (sponsored by NASA) in which I applied data science and machine learning (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) on the following research topics:
- Exoplanet classification
- Exoplanet habitability analysis & prediction
- Stellar System classification

Our research findings have been published at Galaxies Journal on Dec 3rd, 2024:
