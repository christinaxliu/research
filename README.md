This git repository contains the source code for my research projects and work.

At this moment, it contains:
- Research during summer research internship and year-long research program with the **Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) @ California Institute of Technology**, sponsored by NASA (https://www.caltech.edu/research/jpl).
- Research project presented at the 68th **Washington State Science and Engineering Fair** (WSSEF 2025 https://wssef.org/) where I won the **First Place** in the **Physics and Astronomy** category (Grade 9 - 12th).


### JPL, Caltech (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL-Caltech)
For my research at JPL, Caltech, I applied data science and machine learning (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) on the following research topics:
- Exoplanet classification
- Exoplanet habitability analysis & prediction
- Analysis of stellar and planetary parameters that influence habitability
- Planetary system classification

The source code for my research work can be found at: https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL-Caltech, and the research progress reports can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1B1dRrJqGsRwMK8p4BuehumHlxLMfq-EP.

Our research findings have been published at ***Galaxies Journal*** on Dec 3rd, 2024:

### WSSEF (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/WSSEF)
I won the **First Place** in the **Physics and Astronomy** category (Grade 9 - 12th) in the 68th [Washington State Science and Engineering Fair](https://wssef.org/) (WSSEF 2025) with my research project - **An Analysis of Exoplanet Habitability and Most Influential Stellar and Planetary Parameters to Habitability through the Lens of Machine Learning**.
