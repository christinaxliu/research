This git repository contains the source code for my research projects and work during my summer research internship and year-long research program with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology (sponsored by NASA) in which I applied data science and machine learning (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) on the following research topics:
- Exoplanet classification
- Exoplanet habitability analysis & prediction
- Analysis of stellar and planetary parameters that influence habitability
- Planetary system classification

The source code for my research work can be found at: https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL, and the research progress reports can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1B1dRrJqGsRwMK8p4BuehumHlxLMfq-EP.
