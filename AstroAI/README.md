I applied explainable machine learning technique, [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on my exoplanet habitability models, not only identifying the most influential stellar/planetary properties for habitability, but also quantitatively understanding how higher/lower values of these properties shift an exoplanet towards or away from habitability. I was invitated to the [*AstroAI Workshop 2025*](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/workshop/details.html) at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) for a [poster presentation](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/workshop/abstracts/posters/liu.html) of my work ([Abstract](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/workshop/abstracts/posters/liu.html) | [Poster](https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/blob/main/AstroAI/AstroAI_Poster_2025.pdf)).

Below is the abstract of my poster presented at [*AstroAI Workshop 2025*](https://astroai.cfa.harvard.edu/workshop/details.html):
