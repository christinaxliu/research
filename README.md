This git repository contains the source code for my research projects and work.

At this moment, it contains:
- Research during summer research internship and year-long research program with the **Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) @ California Institute of Technology**, sponsored by NASA (https://www.caltech.edu/research/jpl).
- Research project for participating in the **Central Sound Regional Science and Engineering Fair** (CSRSEF https://centralsoundfair.org/) and **Washington State Science and Engineering Fair** (WSSEF https://wssef.org/).


### JPL, Caltech (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL-Caltech)
For my research at JPL, Caltech, I applied data science and machine learning (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) on the following research topics:
- Exoplanet classification
- Exoplanet habitability analysis & prediction
- Analysis of stellar and planetary parameters that influence habitability
- Planetary system classification

The source code for my research work can be found at: https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL-Caltech, and the research progress reports can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1B1dRrJqGsRwMK8p4BuehumHlxLMfq-EP.

Our research findings have been published at Galaxies Journal on Dec 3rd, 2024:

### CSRSEF (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/CSRSEF)
### WSSEF (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/WSSEF)
I am working on participating in the CSRSEF and WSSEF with research project - An Analysis of Exoplanet Habitability and Most Influential Stellar and Planetary Parameters to Habitability through the Lens of Machine Learning. Below is the poster for my research project at both CSRSEF and WSSEF:
