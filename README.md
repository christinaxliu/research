This repository contains source code (including Google Colab notebooks) for research projects and work.

At the moment, it mainly contains the work during the summer research internship and year long research program with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology on the following topics:
- Exoplanet classification
- Exoplanet habitabiliy analysis
- Exoplanet habitability classifiers (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)

Our research findings have been published at Galaxies Journal on Dec 3rd, 2024 - Analysis of Habitability and Stellar Habitable Zones from Observed Exoplanets (https://doi.org/10.3390/galaxies12060086)
- The source code for the Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers can be found at: https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL-Caltech/GalaxiesPaper2024/HabitableExoplanetClassifiers
