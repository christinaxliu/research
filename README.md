This git repository contains the source code (including the Google Colab notebooks) for my research projects and work.

At this moment, it contains:
- Research during summer research internship and year-long research program with the **Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) @ California Institute of Technology**, sponsored by NASA (https://www.caltech.edu/research/jpl).
- Research project for participating in the **Central Sound Regional Science and Engineering Fair** (CSRSE https://centralsoundfair.org/), a regional science & engineering fair towards the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF).

### JPL, Caltech (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/JPL-Caltech)
For my research at JPL, Caltech, I applied data science and machine learning (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) on the following research topics:
- Exoplanet classification
- Exoplanet habitability analysis & prediction
- Stellar System classification

Our research findings have been published at Galaxies Journal on Dec 3rd, 2024:

### CSRSE (https://github.com/christinaxliu/research/tree/main/CSRSEF)
I am currently working a research project - An Analysis of Exoplanet Habitability and Most Influential Stellar and Planetary Parameters to Habitability through the Lens of Machine Learning.
